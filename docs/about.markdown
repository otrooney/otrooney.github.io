A developer in the field of quantitative finance by day, I tinker with various projects in my
free time, and have recently begun working on some projects in the area of real-time rendering.
This blog is intended as a place to talk about some of these projects I've been working on
while teaching myself the topic, along with any ideas or thoughts which I think are worth
sharing.

As someone who's only starting out on a journey of learning about computer graphics myself,
there's a good chance that a lot of what I write will have already been covered elsewhere
with much greater accuracy and detail by people a lot smarter than me. Still, I hope that I
can bring some new ideas and a fresh perspective, and perhaps that could be of interest to
a more educated audience.

Feedback and corrections are always appreciated.
