After several years working as a developer in the field of quantitative finance, I've decided
to change things up and pursue a new career in real-time rendering. This blog is intended as
a place to talk about some of the projects I've been working on while teaching myself the new
field, along with any ideas or thoughts which I think are worth sharing.

As someone who's only starting out on a journey of learning about computer graphics myself,
there's a good chance that a lot of what I write will have already been covered elsewhere
with much greater accuracy and detail by people a lot smarter than me. Still, I hope that I
can bring some new ideas and a fresh perspective, and perhaps that could be of interest to
a more educated audience.

Feedback and corrections are always appreciated.
